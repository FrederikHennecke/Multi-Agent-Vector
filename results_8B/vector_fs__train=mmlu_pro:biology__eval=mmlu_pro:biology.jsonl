Glomerular filtration is the process by which the kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.

The glomerular capillaries have a unique structure, with thin walls that allow for the passage of small molecules, such as water and ions, but not larger molecules like proteins and blood cells.\n\n3. The blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries is higher than the pressure in Bowman's capsule, which is a cup-like structure that surrounds the glomeruli.

However, it's not the most direct evidence that DNA is the genetic material.\n\nB: The presence of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts, but not in the cell nucleus, is evidence that DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is incorrect. The presence of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts actually suggests that these organelles have their own genetic material, which is separate from the DNA in the cell nucleus.\n\nC: The constant amount of DNA in all body cells and half the amount in germ cells is evidence that DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is incorrect. The amount of DNA in cells can vary depending on the type of cell and its function. For example, muscle cells have more DNA than nerve cells.\n\nD: The varying amount of RNA in cells indicates that DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is incorrect. The amount of RNA in cells can vary depending on the type of cell and its function, but it does not directly indicate that DNA is the genetic material.\n\nE: The ratio of adenine to thymine varies greatly between different types of cells, suggesting DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is incorrect. The ratio of adenine to thymine (A:T ratio) is a characteristic of DNA, but it does not vary greatly between different types of cells. The A:T ratio is a constant 1:1 in DNA.\n\nF: The presence of histones in cells proves that DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is incorrect. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around, but their presence does not prove that DNA is the genetic material.\n\nG: The correlation between the complexity of an organism and the amount of DNA in its cells points to DNA as the genetic material.\n- This statement is correct. The amount of DNA in an organism's cells is often correlated with its complexity, suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.\n\nH: The ability to synthesize proteins directly from RNA without DNA involvement demonstrates that DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is incorrect. While RNA can be used to synthesize proteins, this does not demonstrate that DNA is the genetic material. In fact, it suggests the opposite, as RNA is involved in protein synthesis.\n\nI: The consistency of DNA sequences across different species suggests that DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is correct. The consistency of DNA sequences across different species is strong evidence that DNA is the genetic material, as it suggests that DNA is a universal genetic code.\n\nJ: Polyploid tissues have multiple sets of chromosomes, which shows DNA is the genetic material.\n- This statement is correct.

In such environments, the amount of water in the plant cells remains at a constant level due to a specific mechanism.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA: Osmotic pressure regulates the influx of water - Osmotic pressure is a force that acts to equalize the concentration of solutes between two solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane.
