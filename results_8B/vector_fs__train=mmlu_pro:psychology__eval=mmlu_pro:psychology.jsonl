While some women may experience psychological consequences, the majority do not experience severe guilt and depression.

Research suggests that women who have abortions are just as likely to want children in the future as women who do not have abortions.\n\nI: the majority of women experience severe post-traumatic stress disorder - This statement is not accurate. While some women may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the majority do not experience severe PTSD.\n\nJ: most women who have abortions suffer from severe depression and anxiety for years afterward - This statement is not accurate.

Social ostracism, or being excluded from social interactions, can further exacerbate these difficulties and potentially reinforce antisocial behavior as a means of coping or seeking attention. This could have a significant influence on learning in people with antisocial personalities.\n\n2. **Money (B):** While financial resources can impact learning opportunities and access to education, there is no direct link between money and the specific learning processes or behaviors associated with antisocial personalities. Money might influence the environment in which learning takes place, but it does not directly affect the learning process itself in individuals with antisocial personalities.\n\n3. **Tranquilizers (C):** Tranquilizers are medications used to treat anxiety and other mental health conditions. While they can affect mood and behavior, there is no direct evidence that tranquilizers have a significant influence on learning in people with antisocial personalities. Their primary function is to manage symptoms, not to impact learning processes.\n\n4. **Physical punishment (D):** Physical punishment is often associated with negative outcomes, including increased aggression and antisocial behavior in children. However, its effectiveness in influencing learning in people with antisocial personalities is questionable. In fact, research suggests that physical punishment can actually worsen behavior and learning outcomes in individuals with antisocial tendencies.\n\nConsidering the options, social ostracism (A) appears to have the strongest influence on learning in people with antisocial personalities.

Education level can increase conformity by providing a common framework of knowledge and understanding, while career can also contribute to conformity due to the need to fit in with professional norms. However, gender can be a factor that decreases conformity, as individuals may resist conforming to societal expectations based on their gender.\n\nB: Socio-economic status, personality type, and age - Socio-economic status can influence conformity, as individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds may be more likely to conform to social norms. Personality type can also play a role, with individuals who are more extroverted or agreeable being more likely to conform. Age can also be a factor, as younger individuals may be more likely to conform to peer pressure.\n\nC: Religion, political belief, and family background - These variables can significantly influence conformity. Religion and political belief can provide a clear set of rules and expectations that individuals must follow, increasing conformity. Family background can also play a role, as individuals may conform to the values and norms of their family.\n\nD: The time of day, weather conditions, and geographical location - These variables are unlikely to have a significant impact on conformity.

The WISC is a standardized test that measures cognitive abilities in children. The scores are typically distributed in a bell-shaped curve, with the majority of the population scoring around the mean (average) and fewer individuals scoring at the extremes.\n\nThe WISC scores are standardized to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This means that about 68% of the population will score between 85 and 115 (i.e., within 1 standard deviation of the mean). \n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130. To do this, we can use the z-scores to find the percentage of the population that falls within this range.\n\nThe z-score formula is: z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the score, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the lower bound (70), the z-score is: z = (70 - 100) / 15 = -1.33.\n\nFor the upper bound (130), the z-score is: z = (130 - 100) / 15 = 1.33.\n\nUsing a z-table or a standard normal distribution calculator, we can find the area under the curve between z = -1.33 and z = 1.33.

Understand the situation: Samuel has just received a bonus at work, but he feels like he's about to be fired. This seems like an irrational response to a positive event.\n\n3.

Samuel's response is an exaggeration of the situation, but it's not the best fit.\n   C: Minimization - This involves downplaying the importance or consequences of a situation. This is the opposite of what Samuel is doing.\n   D: Arbitrary inference - This involves making an assumption without evidence. Samuel is making an assumption that he's about to be fired, but it's not necessarily arbitrary.\n   E: Overgeneralization - This involves making a broad conclusion based on a single event or experience. Samuel's response is an overgeneralization of the situation.\n   F: Magical thinking - This involves believing that unrelated events are connected.
