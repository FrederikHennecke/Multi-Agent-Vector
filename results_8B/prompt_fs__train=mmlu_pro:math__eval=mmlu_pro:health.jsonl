The kidneys' energy expenditure is approximately 5-6% of the total body's energy expenditure.\n\n5. Liver: The liver is a vital organ that performs many functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and metabolism. Its energy expenditure is relatively high, as it needs to process a large volume of blood and perform various metabolic functions. The liver's energy expenditure is approximately 5-6% of the total body's energy expenditure.\n\n6. Brain: The brain is the most energy-intensive organ in the body, as it requires a constant supply of energy to function. Its energy expenditure is approximately 20% of the total body's energy expenditure.\n\n7. Stomach: The stomach is responsible for digesting food and breaking down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Its energy expenditure is relatively low, as it does not require a lot of energy to function. The stomach's energy expenditure is approximately 2-3% of the total body's energy expenditure.\n\n8. Skeletal Muscle: Skeletal muscle is responsible for movement and locomotion. Its energy expenditure is relatively high, as it needs to contract and relax to move the body's skeleton. The skeletal muscle's energy expenditure is approximately 20-30% of the total body's energy expenditure.\n\n9. Pancreas: The pancreas produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels. Its energy expenditure is relatively low, as it does not require a lot of energy to function. The pancreas' energy expenditure is approximately 2-3% of the total body's energy expenditure.\n\nConsidering the energy expenditure of each organ, the intestines, lungs, stomach, and pancreas have relatively low energy expenditure, ranging from 2-3% of the total body's energy expenditure.

Feeding through a gastrostomy tube: This involves placing a tube directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. However, this may not be the best option for a patient who has undergone recent abdominal surgery, as it may cause further complications.\n\nB. Central hyperalimentation: This involves delivering nutrients directly into a major vein, bypassing the digestive system. This is typically used for patients who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract but are unable to eat due to other reasons.\n\nC. Oral fat-free modular diet: This is a type of diet that is low in fat and can be used for patients who have difficulty digesting fats. However, this patient has been unable to eat for 6 days, so an oral diet may not be feasible.\n\nD. Intravenous dextrose solution: This is a type of IV fluid that provides glucose for energy. While it can provide some calories, it is not a complete nutritional solution and may not meet the patient's nutritional needs.\n\nE.

Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).\n\nGiven that the frequency of males affected with the condition is 0.10 (one in ten), this means that 10% of males are affected.\n\nSince the gene is X-linked recessive, females can be affected if they inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent), or if they inherit one copy of the mutated gene and are homozygous recessive for the other X chromosome. However, females can also be carriers of the condition if they inherit one copy of the mutated gene and one normal gene.\n\nThe frequency of affected females is determined by the frequency of males affected, as well as the frequency of carriers. However, the question does not provide information about the frequency of carriers. \n\nHowever, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to estimate the frequency of carriers. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that the frequency of alleles in a population remains constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the mutated gene as q and the frequency of the normal gene as p. The frequency of affected males is q^2 (since they need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene). We are given that q^2 = 0.10.\n\nTo find the frequency of carriers, we need to find q, which is the square root of 0.10. \n\nq = sqrt(0.10) = 0.3162 (approximately)\n\nThe frequency of carriers is 2pq, where p is 1-q. \n\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.3162 = 0.6838\n\nThe frequency of carriers is 2pq = 2 * 0.3162 * 0.6838 = 0.4325 (approximately)\n\nHowever, the question asks for the expected frequency of affected females.

Menarche occurred at 12 years, and menses were regular until they became irregular 1 year ago. This suggests that the patient's menstrual irregularity is a relatively recent development.\n\n2. **Physical Characteristics**: The patient is emaciated, with a low BMI of 15 kg/m^2. This indicates that she is underweight.\n\n3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient's pulse is 54/min, which is lower than the normal range (60-100 beats per minute). Her blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, which is lower than the normal range (90-120/60-80 mm Hg).\n\n4. **Activity Level**: The patient is a member of her high school gymnastics team, which suggests that she is physically active.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can evaluate the options:\n\n- **A.

Cushing's Syndrome**: Cushing's syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder that can cause amenorrhea, but it is typically associated with weight gain, not emaciation.\n\n- **D. Premature Ovarian Failure**: Premature ovarian failure is a condition in which the ovaries stop functioning before the age of 40, but it is not typically associated with emaciation or low blood pressure.\n\n- **E. Hyperthyroidism**: Hyperthyroidism can cause amenorrhea, but it is typically associated with weight loss, not emaciation.\n\n- **F. Pregnancy**: Pregnancy is a common cause of amenorrhea, but the patient's low BMI and physical examination findings make this less likely.\n\n- **G. Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism**: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce enough gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This can cause amenorrhea, particularly in the context of a low BMI and physical inactivity.\n\n- **H.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is elevated, which can be a complication of PE.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA: Wheezing or whistling sound when breathing - This is more indicative of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), not PAH.\n\nB: Constant chest pain - While chest pain is a symptom of PE, it is not specific to PAH.\n\nC: Blue lips or skin - This is a sign of hypoxia, which can occur in PE, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nD: Shortness of breath after slight activity - This is a symptom of both PE and PAH, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nE: P2 louder than A2 - This is a specific sign of PAH. In PAH, the pulmonary artery pressure is elevated, which causes the pulmonary valve to close later in systole, resulting in a louder P2 sound compared to the A2 sound.\n\nF: Peripheral edema - This is a symptom of right-sided heart failure, which can be a complication of PAH, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nG: Presence of an S3 - An S3 heart sound is a sign of volume overload, which can occur in heart failure, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nH: Increased jugular venous pressure - This is a sign of right-sided heart failure, which can be a complication of PAH, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nI: Rapid heart rate - This is a symptom of both PE and PAH, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nJ: Coughing up blood - This is a symptom of PE, but it is not specific to PAH.\n\nTherefore, the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient is a P2 louder than A2.\n\nANSWER: E"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution correctly identifies the specific sign of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the context of a pulmonary embolism (PE).
