In this case, it's imposed on the production of good X.\n\n2. **Analyzing the effect of an excise tax on the market**:\n   - When an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X, the producer will face an increased cost for producing the good.\n   - To minimize losses, the producer will try to pass on this additional cost to the consumer by increasing the price of the good.\n\n3. **Elasticity of demand**:\n   - **Elastic demand**: If the demand curve is perfectly elastic (A), a small change in price will lead to a large change in quantity demanded. In this case, the producer will not be able to pass on the entire tax to the consumer, as the consumer will significantly reduce their demand in response to a price increase.\n   - **Inelastic demand**: If the demand curve is less elastic, a small change in price will lead to a small change in quantity demanded.

However, the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable affects the variance of the slope estimator, which in turn affects the standard error.

However, we can simplify this by considering the formula for the variance of the slope estimator, which is given by Var(b) = \u03c3^2 / (\u2211(xi - x\u0304)^2). From this formula, we can see that the variance of the slope estimator decreases as the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable increases.

Therefore, statement (ii) is true.\n\n(iii) The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size:\nThe standard error of the slope coefficient is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size (n).

This means that the demand for a particular good or service drives the production of that good or service.\n\n2. **Producer Profits**: Companies and producers aim to maximize their profits by producing goods and services that meet the demands of consumers. If a product is in high demand, producers will produce more to meet that demand and make a profit.\n\n3. **Competition**: In a pure capitalist system, there is competition among producers to sell their goods and services.

This is in contrast to the standard GARCH model, which only models the variance of the return series.\n\n2. **GARCH-in-mean parameter**: The GARCH-in-mean parameter is the coefficient of the variance term in the mean equation of the GARCH-M model.

Robin's nominal income increased by 100% ($60,000 - $30,000 = $30,000 increase), but the prices also increased by 200%. So, the purchasing power of Robin's income decreased.\n\n6. To find the real income, we need to adjust Robin's nominal income for the inflation. Since the prices tripled, we can divide Robin's nominal income by 3 to get the real income.\n\n   Real income = Nominal income / (1 + inflation rate)\n   Real income = $60,000 / 3\n   Real income = $20,000\n\n7. Comparing the real income ($20,000) to the original income ($30,000), we can see that Robin's real income decreased by 33.33% ($10,000 decrease).\n\nTherefore, Robin's nominal income increased, but his real income decreased.\n\nANSWER: F."], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution correctly identifies that Robin's nominal income increased due to the 100% increase in income, but then correctly adjusts for inflation by dividing the nominal income by 3 to find the real income.

If there are fewer smaller-scale projects, it could lead to a decrease in the overall number of houses being built, as smaller-scale projects often cater to a wider range of buyers, including first-time homebuyers and those looking for smaller homes.\n\n6. A decrease in the number of houses being built could lead to a decrease in the demand for housing, which could cause housing prices to become more volatile.\n\n7. However, it's also possible that the increased competition from commercial banks could lead to more financing options for buyers, potentially making it easier for people to buy houses.\n\nConsidering these steps, the most likely outcome is that housing prices would become more volatile due to the increased competition and potential decrease in the number of houses being built.\n\nANSWER: F"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The reasoning provided is thorough and logical, considering the potential effects of commercial banks competing with mutual savings banks on the housing construction industry.

If the required reserve ratio is 20%, (a) how much additional money can the bank lend, and (b) how much can the banking system as a whole add to the money supply as a result of the loan?\nA: $10,000 and $50,000\nB: $30,000 and $150,000\nC: $15,000 and $75,000\nD: $20,000 and $100,000", "gold": "C", "conversation": [["GENERATOR", "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the required reserve for the bank.\nThe required reserve ratio is 20%, which means the bank needs to keep 20% of its deposits in reserve. \nRequired reserve = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the excess reserve available for lending.\nThe bank has $100,000 in deposits and needs to keep $20,000 in reserve. \nExcess reserve = Total deposits - Required reserve = $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the additional money the bank can lend.\nThe bank can lend the excess reserve, which is $80,000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total money the banking system can add to the money supply as a result of the loan.\nWhen the bank lends $80,000, it will receive $80,000 in new deposits. These new deposits will also be subject to the 20% reserve requirement. \nNew required reserve = 20% of $80,000 = 0.20 * $80,000 = $16,000.\nNew excess reserve = $80,000 - $16,000 = $64,000.\nThe bank can lend this new excess reserve, which is $64,000. However, this process can repeat, and the banking system can add more money to the supply. \nWe need to calculate the total amount the banking system can add to the money supply as a result of the loan.\n\nLet's continue the process:\n- The bank lends $80,000 and receives $80,000 in new deposits.\n- The new deposits are subject to a 20% reserve requirement, so the bank needs to keep $16,000 in reserve and can lend $64,000.\n- The $64,000 is deposited into the bank, and the process repeats.\n\nWe can see that the banking system can add $64,000 + $64,000 + $64,000 +... (infinite series) to the money supply. This is a geometric series with the first term a = $64,000 and the common ratio r = 1. \nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by S = a / (1 - r). \nS = $64,000 / (1 - 1) = $64,000 / 0 = infinity. However, this is not a valid answer because we cannot have an infinite sum in this context. We need to consider the problem in a different way.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem:\n- The bank lends $80,000 and receives $80,000 in new deposits.\n- The new deposits are subject to a 20% reserve requirement, so the bank needs to keep $16,000 in reserve and can lend $64,000.\n- The $64,000 is deposited into the bank, and the process repeats.\n\nWe can see that the banking system can add $64,000 + $64,000 + $64,000 +... (infinite series) to the money supply. However, we can simplify this problem by considering the ratio of the new deposits to the initial loan. \nThe ratio of the new deposits to the initial loan is 1:1, and the ratio of the new loans to the new deposits is also 1:1. \nSo, the total amount the banking system can add to the money supply as a result of the loan is 1 + 1 + 1 +...

The question asks whether this principle still applies in the context of large corporations. To answer this, we need to consider the differences between small businesses and large corporations.\n\n3.

While the global economy is becoming increasingly interconnected, the principle of the \"invisible hand\" can still be applied to national economies.\n\nG: Smith's principle does not account for externalities affecting the economy - This option is a valid point.

The bank's initial reserve is $62,500, which is 25% of its initial deposits ($250,000). This means the bank has already met its reserve requirement.\n4. When a depositor withdraws $10,000 in currency, the bank's deposits decrease by $10,000.\n5. Since the bank has already met its reserve requirement, it can lend out 75% of its deposits. Initially, it can lend out 75% of $250,000, which is $187,500.\n6. When the depositor withdraws $10,000, the bank's deposits decrease to $240,000.

The FED sells $3,000,000 in government bonds to the public. This means the FED is removing $3,000,000 from the banking system.\n\n2. Since all commercial banks are fully \"loaned up\" (i.e., their excess reserves are zero), the banks have no excess funds to lend. When the FED sells bonds to the public, the banks will receive the $3,000,000 from the sale, but they will not have any excess reserves to lend.\n\n3. However, the banks will still have to keep a 25% reserve requirement for the $3,000,000 they received from the sale. This means they will have to keep $750,000 (25% of $3,000,000) in reserve and can lend out the remaining $2,250,000.\n\n4. When the banks lend out the $2,250,000, this money will be deposited into the accounts of the borrowers, increasing the money supply.\n\n5. The borrowers will then use this money to make purchases, which will lead to further deposits into the banking system. For every $1,000 deposited, the bank will have to keep a 25% reserve and can lend out 75% ($750).\n\n6. Let's calculate the total amount that can be lent out:\n   - Initially, the bank can lend out $2,250,000.\n   - The borrowers will deposit this amount, and the bank will have to keep 25% in reserve and can lend out 75% of the deposited amount, which is $1,687,500.\n   - The borrowers will deposit this amount, and the bank will have to keep 25% in reserve and can lend out 75% of the deposited amount, which is $1,250,000.\n   - The borrowers will deposit this amount, and the bank will have to keep 25% in reserve and can lend out 75% of the deposited amount, which is $937,500.\n   - The borrowers will deposit this amount, and the bank will have to keep 25% in reserve and can lend out 75% of the deposited amount, which is $703,125.\n\n7. We can see that the amount lent out will decrease by 75% each time, forming a geometric series: $2,250,000, $1,687,500, $1,250,000, $937,500, $703,125,...\n\n8. The sum of this infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n   - a = $2,250,000\n   - r = 0.75 (since the amount lent out decreases by 75% each time)\n   - S = $2,250,000 / (1 - 0.75) = $9,000,000\n\n9. Therefore, the total amount that can be lent out is $9,000,000.\n\n10. The initial $3,000,000 sale by the FED will lead to a total of $9,000,000 being added to the money supply.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the initial $3,000,000 sale by the FED.
