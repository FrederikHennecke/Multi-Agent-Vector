{"id": 34, "question": "Company A has found that if it offers a guarantee on its transistor radios, more will be sold than without the guarantee. In a year, the company expects to sell 100 radios if no guarantee is offered, but if the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 + 5t. It is known that 10% of radios sold will fail each year. The cost of fixing a radio is $1 and a profit of $2.80 is made on every radio sold. What is the length of the guarantee period t that maximizes profit?\nA: 2 years\nB: 3 years\nC: 6 years\nD: 4 years\nE: 8 years\nF: 10 years\nG: 9 years\nH: 7 years\nI: 1 year\nJ: 5 years", "gold": "D", "conversation": [["GENERATOR", "To find the length of the guarantee period t that maximizes profit, we need to calculate the profit for each possible value of t and compare them.\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of radios sold with the guarantee:\n   Q = 100 + 5t\n\n2. Calculate the number of radios that will fail each year:\n   Failure rate = 10% per year\n   Number of radios that will fail in t years = 0.1 * Q = 0.1 * (100 + 5t)\n\n3. Calculate the cost of fixing the failed radios:\n   Cost of fixing failed radios = Number of radios that will fail in t years * $1 = 0.1 * (100 + 5t)\n\n4. Calculate the profit from selling radios with the guarantee:\n   Profit from selling radios = Number of radios sold * $2.80 = (100 + 5t) * $2.80\n\n5. Calculate the total profit:\n   Total profit = Profit from selling radios - Cost of fixing failed radios\n   Total profit = (100 + 5t) * $2.80 - 0.1 * (100 + 5t)\n\n6. Simplify the total profit equation:\n   Total profit = $280 + $14t - $10 - $0.5t\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5t\n\n7. To maximize profit, we need to find the value of t that maximizes the total profit equation. Since the equation is linear, the maximum profit will occur at the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b / 2a.\n\n   In this case, a = 13.5 and b = 270. However, since the equation is linear, the vertex is at the point where the line intersects the y-axis, which is at x = 0. But we need to find the value of t that maximizes the profit, so we will use the equation to find the value of t that gives the maximum profit.\n\n   Since the equation is linear, the maximum profit will occur at the maximum value of t. We will try the values of t given in the options.\n\n   Let's try t = 1:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(1) = $283.50\n\n   Let's try t = 2:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(2) = $297\n\n   Let's try t = 3:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(3) = $310.50\n\n   Let's try t = 4:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(4) = $323.50\n\n   Let's try t = 5:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(5) = $336.50\n\n   Let's try t = 6:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(6) = $349.50\n\n   Let's try t = 7:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(7) = $362.50\n\n   Let's try t = 8:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(8) = $375.50\n\n   Let's try t = 9:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(9) = $388.50\n\n   Let's try t = 10:\n   Total profit = $270 + $13.5(10) = $401.50\n\n   From the calculations, we can see that the maximum profit occurs at t = 10.\n\nHowever, we need to check if t = 10 is among the options.

If profit is defined as zero if the contractor does not get the job (his bid is greater than the low bid) and as the difference between his bid and the cost estimate c if he gets the job, what should he bid, in terms of c, in order to maximize his expected profit?\nA: k = (7c / 4)\nB: k = (3c / 2)\nC: k = (3c / 4)\nD: k = (c / 3)\nE: k = (4c / 3)\nF: k = c\nG: k = (2c / 3)\nH: k = (5c / 4)\nI: k = (5c / 3)\nJ: k = (c / 2)", "gold": "B", "conversation": [["GENERATOR", "To solve this problem, we need to find the bid that maximizes the expected profit. \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The low bid is a random variable uniformly distributed over the interval (3c/4, 2c). This means that the probability density function (pdf) of the low bid is:\n\nf(x) = 1 / (2c - 3c/4) = 4 / (2c) = 2 / c for 3c/4 \u2264 x \u2264 2c\n\n2. The contractor's profit is zero if his bid (k) is greater than the low bid (x), and it's k - c if his bid is less than or equal to the low bid. So, the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = (k - c) if k \u2264 x\nProfit = 0 if k > x\n\n3. To find the expected profit, we need to integrate the profit function over the possible values of the low bid. Since the low bid is uniformly distributed, we can write the expected profit as:\n\nE[Profit] = \u222b[3c/4, 2c] (k - c) f(x) dx + \u222b[2c, k] 0 f(x) dx\n\n4. Since f(x) = 2/c, we can simplify the integrals:\n\nE[Profit] = \u222b[3c/4, 2c] (k - c) (2/c) dx + \u222b[2c, k] 0 (2/c) dx\n= (2/c) \u222b[3c/4, 2c] (k - c) dx + 0\n= (2/c) [(k - c) x] from 3c/4 to 2c\n= (2/c) [(k - c) (2c) - (k - c) (3c/4)]\n= (2/c) [(2kc - 2c^2 - 3kc/4 + 3c^2/4)]\n= (2/c) [(2kc - 3kc/4 - 2c^2 + 3c^2/4)]\n= (2/c) [(6kc - 3kc - 8c^2 + 6c^2)/4]\n= (2/c) [(3kc - 2c^2)/4]\n= (3k - 2c)/2\n\n5. To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of k that maximizes the expression (3k - 2c)/2. This is a linear function of k, so it's maximized when k is as large as possible. However, we also need to make sure that k is less than or equal to the low bid (2c), since the profit is zero if k > x.\n\n6. To find the maximum value of k, we set k = 2c and substitute it into the expression for the expected profit:\n\nE[Profit] = (3(2c) - 2c)/2\n= (6c - 2c)/2\n= 4c/2\n= 2c\n\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices. We need to find the value of k that maximizes the expected profit while keeping it less than or equal to 2c.\n\n7. Since the expected profit is a linear function of k, we can find the maximum value of k by setting the derivative of the expected profit with respect to k equal to zero:\n\nd(E[Profit])/dk = d((3k - 2c)/2)/dk = 3/2\n\nHowever, this is not a function of k, so we cannot set it equal to zero.

The correct approach to find the selling cost percentage is to first find the commission earned by JimDagney. Since his average weekly earnings are $120 and his average weekly sales are $2,000, we can find the commission as follows: Commission = Total earnings - Salary. However, we don't know the salary. We can use the sales to find the commission. Commission = Sales - Cost. We are trying to find the selling cost percentage, which is the cost as a percentage of the sales. Let's call the cost 'x'. Commission = $2,000 - x. The commission is also equal to $120 - S. Setting these equal to each other, we get $2,000 - x = $120 - S. However, we can simplify this problem by using the fact that the commission is a percentage of the sales. Let's assume the commission rate is 'r'. Then, the commission is $2,000r. The total earnings are $120, which is the sum of the commission and the salary. So, we can write: $120 = $2,000r + S. We know that the commission is $2,000 - x, so we can set up the equation: $2,000 - x = $2,000r. Simplifying the equation: x = $2,000(1 - r). Now, we can find the selling cost percentage by dividing the cost by the sales and multiplying by 100: Selling cost percentage = (x / $2,000) * 100 = ($2,000(1 - r) / $2,000) * 100 = (1 - r) * 100. We know that the commission is $120, so we can set up the equation: $120 = $2,000r. Solving for r: r = $120 / $2,000 = 0.06 = 6%. Now, we can find the selling cost percentage: Selling cost percentage = (1 - r) * 100 = (1 - 0.06) * 100 = 0.94 * 100 = 94%. However, this is the cost percentage, not the selling cost percentage. To find the selling cost percentage, we need to subtract the cost percentage from 100: Selling cost percentage = 100 - 94% = 6%.

We know that the commission is $120, so we can set up the equation: $120 = $2,000r. Solving for r: r = $120 / $2,000 = 0.06 = 6%. However, this is the commission rate, not the selling cost percentage. The correct selling cost percentage is actually 1 - r = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 = 94% is the cost percentage, not the selling cost percentage.

The total purchase amount is $1,500, and the \"floor goods\" purchased are $200 worth, which will sell for $250. This means the profit on the \"floor goods\" is $50 ($250 - $200).\n\n2. The total profit on the \"floor goods\" is $50, and this profit is a part of the total desired profit, which is 40% of the total selling price.\n\n3. Let's assume the total selling price is S. The total profit is 40% of S, which is 0.4S.\n\n4. The profit on the \"floor goods\" is $50, and this is a part of the total profit (0.4S). So, we can set up the equation: 50 = 0.4S - (desired profit on the balance of purchases).\n\n5. We know that the total purchase amount is $1,500, and the \"floor goods\" are $200 worth. So, the balance of purchases is $1,500 - $200 = $1,300.\n\n6. The desired profit on the balance of purchases is 40% of the total selling price (0.4S), but we want to find the markup percentage on the balance of purchases. Let's call this markup percentage x. The desired profit on the balance of purchases is 0.4S - 50 (since we already have a profit of $50 from the \"floor goods\").\n\n7. The selling price of the balance of purchases is the cost of the balance of purchases (x) plus the desired profit on the balance of purchases. So, we can set up the equation: S - $1,300 = (1 + x/100)($1,300) - (0.4S - 50).\n\n8. Simplify the equation: S - $1,300 = $1,300 + $1,300x/100 - 0.4S + 50.\n\n9. Combine like terms: S - $1,300 = $1,300 + $13x - 0.4S + 50.\n\n10. Add 0.4S to both sides: 1.4S - $1,300 = $1,300 + $13x + 50.\n\n11. Subtract $1,300 from both sides: 1.4S - $2,300 = $13x + 50.\n\n12. Add $2,300 to both sides: 1.4S = $13x + $2,350.\n\n13. Subtract $2,350 from both sides: 1.4S - $2,350 = $13x.\n\n14. Divide both sides by 1.4: S - $1,678.57 = $9.29x.\n\n15. Add $1,678.57 to both sides: S = $9.29x + $1,678.57.\n\n16. We know that the total selling price (S) is the sum of the selling price of the \"floor goods\" ($250) and the selling price of the balance of purchases. So, we can set up the equation: S = $250 + ($1,300 + $1,300x/100).\n\n17. Substitute the expression for S from step 15 into the equation: $250 + ($1,300 + $1,300x/100) = $9.29x + $1,678.57.\n\n18. Subtract $250 from both sides: $1,300 + $1,300x/100 = $9.29x + $1,428.57.\n\n19. Subtract $1,300 from both sides: $1,300x/100 = $9.29x + $128.57.\n\n20. Subtract $9.29x from both sides: $1,300x/100 - $9.29x = $128.57.\n\n21. Combine like terms: $1,300x/100 - $929x/100 = $128.57.\n\n22. Factor out x: ($1,300 - $929)x/100 = $128.57.\n\n23. Simplify: ($371)x/100 = $128.57.\n\n24. Multiply both sides by 100: $371x = $12,857.\n\n25. Divide both sides by $371: x = $34.75.\n\n26. To find the markup percentage, divide x by the balance of purchases ($1,300) and multiply by 100: (x/$1,300) * 100 = ($34.75/$1,300) * 100 = 2.6777 * 100 = 267.77%.

Since each firm produces 5 tapes per day, the total output (Q) is 5 times the number of firms (N). However, we don't know the number of firms. Since the industry is perfectly competitive, we assume that the market is in long-run equilibrium, and the number of firms is such that the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR). We can find the MC function first.\n\nStep 2: Find the marginal cost (MC) function. The average cost (AC) is $10 per tape, and the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the average cost (AC) with respect to the quantity (Q). However, we don't know the total cost (TC) function. We can find the total cost (TC) function using the average cost (AC) function.\n\nStep 3: Find the total cost (TC) function. The average cost (AC) is $10 per tape, so the total cost (TC) is the average cost (AC) times the quantity (Q). However, we don't know the number of firms (N). Since the industry is perfectly competitive, we assume that the market is in long-run equilibrium, and the number of firms is such that the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR). We can find the marginal revenue (MR) function first.\n\nStep 4: Find the marginal revenue (MR) function. The total revenue (TR) is the price (P) times the quantity (Q). Since the demand function is Q = D(P) = 1,050 - 50P, we can find the inverse demand function P = D^(-1)(Q) = (1,050 - Q)/50. The total revenue (TR) is P times Q, so TR = P * Q = ((1,050 - Q)/50) * Q = 1,050Q/50 - Q^2/50. The marginal revenue (MR) is the derivative of the total revenue (TR) with respect to the quantity (Q). MR = d(TR)/dQ = 1,050/50 - Q/50 = 21 - Q/50.\n\nStep 5: Find the marginal cost (MC) function. The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the total cost (TC) with respect to the quantity (Q). Since the total cost (TC) is the average cost (AC) times the quantity (Q), TC = AC * Q = 10Q. The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the total cost (TC) with respect to the quantity (Q). MC = d(TC)/dQ = 10.\n\nStep 6: Find the number of firms (N). Since the industry is perfectly competitive, the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR) in long-run equilibrium. Set MC = MR and solve for Q: 10 = 21 - Q/50. Multiply both sides by 50: 500 = 1,050 - Q. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: -550 = -Q. Multiply both sides by -1: Q = 550. Since each firm produces 5 tapes per day, the number of firms (N) is Q/5 = 550/5 = 110.\n\nStep 7: Find the total royalty (TR) paid to film studios. The per-film royalty rate (r) is an increasing function of total industry output (Q): r = 0.002Q. The total royalty (TR) is the royalty rate (r) times the total output (Q): TR = r * Q = 0.002Q * Q = 0.002Q^2.\n\nStep 8: Find the total cost (TC) function. The total cost (TC) is the sum of the total revenue (TR) and the total royalty (TR): TC = TR + TR = 0.002Q^2 + 0.002Q^2 = 0.004Q^2.\n\nStep 9: Find the average cost (AC) function. The average cost (AC) is the total cost (TC) divided by the quantity (Q): AC = TC/Q = 0.004Q^2/Q = 0.004Q.\n\nStep 10: Find the marginal cost (MC) function. The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the average cost (AC) with respect to the quantity (Q): MC = d(AC)/dQ = 0.004.\n\nStep 11: Find the equilibrium price (P).

The total revenue (TR) is P times Q, so TR = P * Q = ((1,050 - Q)/50) * Q = 1,050Q/50 - Q^2/50. The marginal revenue (MR) is the derivative of the total revenue (TR) with respect to the quantity (Q). MR = d(TR)/dQ = 1,050/50 - Q/50 = 21 - Q/50.\n\nStep 2: Find the marginal cost (MC) function. The average cost (AC) is $10 per tape, and the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the average cost (AC) with respect to the quantity (Q). However, we don't need to find the total cost (TC) function. We can find the marginal cost (MC) directly. Since each firm produces 5 tapes per day, the marginal cost (MC) is the average cost (AC) times the number of tapes produced per firm, which is 5. MC = AC * 5 = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nStep 3: Find the equilibrium quantity (Q). Since the industry is perfectly competitive, the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR) in long-run equilibrium. Set MC = MR and solve for Q: 50 = 21 - Q/50. Multiply both sides by 50: 2,500 = 1,050 - Q. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: 1,450 = -Q. Multiply both sides by -1: Q = -1,450.\n\nHowever, the quantity cannot be negative. This is an indication that the marginal cost (MC) is greater than the marginal revenue (MR) for all possible quantities. This means that the industry is not in long-run equilibrium. We need to find the point where the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR).\n\nStep 4: Find the point where the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR). Since the marginal cost (MC) is 50 and the marginal revenue (MR) is 21 - Q/50, we can set MC = MR and solve for Q: 50 = 21 - Q/50. Multiply both sides by 50: 2,500 = 1,050 - Q. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: 1,450 = -Q. Multiply both sides by -1: Q = -1,450. However, this is not a valid solution.\n\nSince the marginal cost (MC) is greater than the marginal revenue (MR) for all possible quantities, we need to find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the average revenue (AR). The average revenue (AR) is the price (P) times the quantity (Q), which is 1,050 - Q/50. Set MR = AR and solve for Q: 21 - Q/50 = (1,050 - Q/50). Multiply both sides by 50: 1,050 - Q = 1,050 - Q/50. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: -Q = -Q/50. Multiply both sides by -50: 50Q = Q. Subtract Q from both sides: 49Q = 0. Divide both sides by 49: Q = 0.\n\nHowever, the quantity cannot be zero. This is an indication that the marginal revenue (MR) is greater than the average revenue (AR) for all possible quantities. This means that the industry is not in long-run equilibrium. We need to find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the average revenue (AR).\n\nStep 5: Find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the average revenue (AR). Since the marginal revenue (MR) is 21 - Q/50 and the average revenue (AR) is 1,050 - Q/50, we can set MR = AR and solve for Q: 21 - Q/50 = 1,050 - Q/50. Multiply both sides by 50: 1,050 - Q = 1,050 - Q. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: -Q = -Q.

However, the correct approach is to find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC) by setting MR = MC and solving for Q.\n\nStep 1: Find the marginal revenue (MR) function. The total revenue (TR) is the price (P) times the quantity (Q). Since the demand function is Q = D(P) = 1,050 - 50P, we can find the inverse demand function P = D^(-1)(Q) = (1,050 - Q)/50. The total revenue (TR) is P times Q, so TR = P * Q = ((1,050 - Q)/50) * Q = 1,050Q/50 - Q^2/50. The marginal revenue (MR) is the derivative of the total revenue (TR) with respect to the quantity (Q). MR = d(TR)/dQ = 1,050/50 - Q/50 = 21 - Q/50.\n\nStep 2: Find the marginal cost (MC) function. The average cost (AC) is $10 per tape, and the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the average cost (AC) with respect to the quantity (Q). However, we don't need to find the total cost (TC) function. We can find the marginal cost (MC) directly. Since each firm produces 5 tapes per day, the marginal cost (MC) is the average cost (AC) times the number of tapes produced per firm, which is 5. MC = AC * 5 = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nStep 3: Find the equilibrium quantity (Q). Since the industry is perfectly competitive, the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR) in long-run equilibrium. Set MC = MR and solve for Q: 50 = 21 - Q/50. Multiply both sides by 50: 2,500 = 1,050 - Q. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: 1,450 = -Q. Multiply both sides by -1: Q = -1,450. However, the quantity cannot be negative.\n\nTo find the correct equilibrium quantity (Q), we need to find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC). Since the marginal revenue (MR) is 21 - Q/50 and the marginal cost (MC) is 50, we can set MR = MC and solve for Q: 21 - Q/50 = 50. Multiply both sides by 50: 1,050 - Q = 2,500. Subtract 1,050 from both sides: -Q = 1,450. Multiply both sides by -1: Q = -1,450. However, this is still incorrect.\n\nSince the marginal cost (MC) is greater than the marginal revenue (MR) for all possible quantities, we need to find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC) by setting MR = MC and solving for Q. However, we can also find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the average revenue (AR) by setting MR = AR and solving for Q.\n\nStep 4: Find the point where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the average revenue (AR). Since the marginal revenue (MR) is 21 - Q/50 and the average revenue (AR) is 1,050 - Q/50, we can set MR = AR and solve for Q: 21 - Q/50 = 1,050 - Q/50.

First, we need to find the discount for 1 month at 6% interest.\n   Discount for 1 month = Face value * Rate * Time\n   Discount for 1 month = $850 * 0.06 * (1/12)\n   Discount for 1 month = $850 * 0.06 * 0.083333\n   Discount for 1 month = $0.4166667\n\n2. Since the note is discounted at 6% a month for 3 months, we need to find the total discount.\n   Total discount = Discount for 1 month * (1 + (1/12) + (1/12)^2)\n   Total discount = $0.4166667 * (1 + 0.083333 + 0.006944)\n   Total discount = $0.4166667 * 1.090278\n   Total discount = $0.4545455\n\n3. Now, we subtract the total discount from the face value of the note to find the proceeds.\n   Proceeds = Face value - Total discount\n   Proceeds = $850 - $0.4545455\n   Proceeds = $849.5455\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are approximately $849.55. However, this option is not available in the given choices. The closest option is $847.50, but it's not the correct answer.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we should re-evaluate the options and consider the closest value to the calculated proceeds. However, the provided solution is incorrect due to the rounding error.\n\nThe correct answer should be the one that is closest to the calculated proceeds, but since the options are not provided, we can't determine the exact answer. However, we can calculate the correct answer using the formula:\n\nProceeds = Face value * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n) / (1 + i)^(-n))\n\nWhere:\n- Face value = $850\n- r = 6% = 0.06\n- i = 6% = 0.06\n- n = 3 months\n\nProceeds = $850 * (1 - (1 + 0.06)^(-3) / (1 + 0.06)^(-3))\nProceeds = $850 * (1 - 0.9411765 / 0.9411765)\nProceeds = $850 * (1 - 1)\nProceeds = $850 * 0\nProceeds = $0\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer, as the note is discounted at 6% a month for 3 months, and the proceeds should be less than the face value.\n\nLet's re-calculate the proceeds using the correct formula:\n\nProceeds = Face value * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n) / (1 + i)^(-n))\n\nWhere:\n- Face value = $850\n- r = 6% = 0.06\n- i = 6% = 0.06\n- n = 3 months\n\nProceeds = $850 * (1 - (1 + 0.06)^(-3) / (1 + 0.06)^(-3))\nProceeds = $850 * (1 - 0.9411765 / 0.9411765"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: INCORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution provided is mostly correct, but it incorrectly rounds the proceeds and fails to provide the correct answer due to the rounding error.

{"id": 261, "question": "How much must be invested in $1,000 5% bonds to have an annual income from interest of $3,000 if the bonds sell at 74(7/8)? Assume a brokerage fee of $5 a bond.\nA: $35,000\nB: $55,000\nC: $45,225\nD: $40,000\nE: $65,000\nF: $50,000\nG: $70,000\nH: $75,000\nI: $60,000\nJ: $30,000", "gold": "C", "conversation": [["GENERATOR", "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  First, we need to find the face value of the bond. Since the annual income from interest is $3,000 and the interest rate is 5%, we can use the formula:\n\n   Interest = Face Value * Rate\n   $3,000 = Face Value * 0.05\n   \n   To find the face value, we divide both sides by 0.05:\n   \n   Face Value = $3,000 / 0.05\n   Face Value = $60,000\n\n2.  Next, we need to find the cost of the bond. The bonds sell at 74(7/8), which is equivalent to 95/128. To find the cost of the bond, we multiply the face value by this fraction:\n   \n   Cost = Face Value * (95/128)\n   Cost = $60,000 * (95/128)\n   Cost = $46,875\n\n3.  However, we also need to consider the brokerage fee of $5 per bond. Since we don't know the number of bonds, let's represent the number of bonds as 'x'. The total cost will be the cost of the bond plus the brokerage fee:\n   \n   Total Cost = Cost + (Brokerage Fee * x)\n   Total Cost = $46,875 + ($5 * x)\n\n4.  We know that the total cost is equal to the amount invested. Let's represent the amount invested as 'A'. We can set up an equation:\n   \n   A = $46,875 + ($5 * x)\n\n5.  We are given that the annual income from interest is $3,000, and we want to find the amount invested. Since the interest rate is 5%, we can use the formula:\n   \n   Interest = Face Value * Rate\n   $3,000 = Face Value * 0.05\n   Face Value = $60,000\n\n6.  Since the face value is $60,000, the number of bonds is:\n   \n   Number of Bonds = Face Value / Cost per Bond\n   Number of Bonds = $60,000 / (Cost per Bond)\n\n7.  The cost per bond is the selling price of the bond, which is 95/128 of the face value. However, we also need to consider the brokerage fee. Let's represent the cost per bond as 'C'. We can set up an equation:\n   \n   C = (95/128) * Face Value + Brokerage Fee\n   C = (95/128) * $60,000 + $5\n\n8.  Now we can find the number of bonds:\n   \n   Number of Bonds = $60,000 / C\n   Number of Bonds = $60,000 / ((95/128) * $60,000 + $5)\n\n9.  Now we can find the amount invested:\n   \n   A = Number of Bonds * Cost per Bond\n   A = ($60,000 / ((95/128) * $60,000 + $5)) * ((95/128) * $60,000 + $5)\n\n10. Simplifying the expression, we get:\n    \n    A = ($60,000 / ($57,187.5 + $5)) * ($57,187.5 + $5)\n    A = ($60,000 / $57,187.5) * $57,187.5\n    A = $1,047.19 * $57,187.5\n    A = $60,000\n\nHowever, this is not among the options. Let's re-evaluate the steps.\n\n11. We can simplify the cost per bond:\n    \n    C = (95/128) * $60,000 + $5\n    C = $46,640.625 + $5\n    C = $46,645.625\n\n12. Now we can find the number of bonds:\n    \n    Number of Bonds = $60,000 / C\n    Number of Bonds = $60,000 / $46,645.625\n    Number of Bonds = 1.288\n\n13. Since we can't buy a fraction of a bond, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Let's round up to 2 bonds.\n\n14. Now we can find the amount invested:\n    \n    A = Number of Bonds * Cost per Bond\n    A = 2 * ($46,645.625 + $10)\n    A = 2 * $46,655.625\n    A = $93,311.25\n\nHowever, this is not among the options.

Let's assume the initial number of members is x. The initial annual fee is $200.\n\n2. The club charges $200 per member, so the initial revenue is 200x.\n\n3. If the number of members exceeds 60, the annual fee is reduced by $2 for each member. So, the new annual fee will be 200 - 2(y - 60), where y is the number of members after the reduction.\n\n4. The new revenue will be (200 - 2(y - 60)) * y.\n\n5. To maximize revenue, we need to find the value of y that maximizes the new revenue.\n\n6. Let's simplify the new revenue equation: (200 - 2(y - 60)) * y = (200 - 2y + 120) * y = (320 - 2y) * y = 320y - 2y^2.\n\n7.

Substitute y = z + 60 into the revenue equation: 320(z + 60) - 2(z + 60)^2.\n\n16. Expand the equation: 320z + 19200 - 2z^2 - 240z - 7200.\n\n17. Simplify the equation: -2z^2 - 20z + 12000.\n\n18.
