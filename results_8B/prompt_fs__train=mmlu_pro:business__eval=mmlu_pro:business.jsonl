(ii) When t represents the number of hours past 9:00 am., express the total cost as a function of t.\nA: 90 pieces\nB: 50 pieces\nC: 60 pieces\nD: 100 pieces\nE: 95 pieces\nF: 70 pieces\nG: 85 pieces\nH: 65 pieces\nI: 75 pieces\nJ: 80 pieces", "gold": "F", "conversation": [["GENERATOR", "To solve this problem, we will break it down into two parts: (i) finding the number of pieces produced by lunch hour, and (ii) expressing the total cost as a function of t.\n\n### Part (i): Finding the number of pieces produced by lunch hour\n\nGiven the equation C (in dollars) = 3m^2 + m + 9, we are told that the cost of the work produced by 9:00 am is $4,849. We need to find the number of pieces produced by 9:00 am, which we will call m0.\n\nWe can substitute C = 4849 into the equation and solve for m0:\n\n4849 = 3m0^2 + m0 + 9\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n3m0^2 + m0 - 4840 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for m0:\n\nm0 = [{-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)} / {2a}]\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 1, and c = -4840. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nm0 = [{-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1^2 - 4(3)(-4840))} / {2(3)}]\nm0 = [{-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 58080)} / 6]\nm0 = [{-1 \u00b1 \u221a58081} / 6]\nm0 = [{-1 \u00b1 241} / 6]\n\nWe have two possible solutions for m0, but since the number of pieces cannot be negative, we take the positive solution:\n\nm0 = [{-1 + 241} / 6]\nm0 = 240 / 6\nm0 = 40\n\nSo, 40 pieces were produced by 9:00 am.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pieces produced from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm. We are given that the rate of manufacture after 9:00 am is 10 pieces per hour. Since there are 3 hours from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, the number of pieces produced during this time is:\n\nm1 = 10 * 3\nm1 = 30\n\nThe total number of pieces produced by lunch hour is the sum of the pieces produced by 9:00 am and the pieces produced from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm:\n\nm_total = m0 + m1\nm_total = 40 + 30\nm_total = 70\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces produced by lunch hour is 70.\n\n### Part (ii): Expressing the total cost as a function of t\n\nLet's denote the number of hours past 9:00 am as t. The number of pieces produced from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm is 10t. The total number of pieces produced is the sum of the pieces produced by 9:00 am and the pieces produced from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm:\n\nm(t) = m0 + 10t\nm(t) = 40 + 10t\n\nThe cost of producing m pieces is given by the equation C = 3m^2 + m + 9. We can substitute m(t) into this equation to express the total cost as a function of t:\n\nC(t) = 3(m(t))^2 + m(t) + 9\nC(t) = 3(40 + 10t)^2 + (40 + 10t) + 9\nC(t) = 3(1600 + 800t + 100t^2) + 40 + 10t + 9\nC(t) = 4800 + 2400t + 300t^2 + 40 + 10t + 9\nC(t) = 300t^2 + 2410t + 4849\n\nTherefore, the total cost as a function of t is C(t) = 300t^2 + 2410t + 4849.\n\nANSWER: J"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution correctly breaks down the problem into two parts and solves each part step by step.

The profit on each radio sold is $2.80, and the cost of fixing a radio is $1. However, we need to account for the radios that will fail within the guarantee period. The probability of a radio failing each year is 10%, or 0.1. \n\nLet's calculate the expected number of radios that will fail within the guarantee period t. This is a geometric series with a first term of 0.1 and a common ratio of 0.1. The sum of this series is:\n\n0.1 / (1 - 0.1) = 0.1 / 0.9 = 1/9\n\nSo, the expected number of radios that will fail within the guarantee period t is (1/9)t.\n\nThe number of radios sold with the guarantee is Q = 100 + 5t.

This is a linear function, so it has a single maximum value at the vertex of the line. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a line with slope m and y-intercept b is -b/m. In this case, the slope is 12.32 and the y-intercept is 280, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\nt = -280 / 12.32\n= -22.78\n\nHowever, t must be a positive number, since it represents the length of the guarantee period.

The probability that the contractor gets the job is the probability that his bid is less than the low bid. Since the low bid is uniformly distributed over the interval (3c/4, 2c), the probability that the low bid is less than k is the length of the interval from 3c/4 to k, divided by the length of the entire interval (3c/4, 2c).\n\nThe length of the interval from 3c/4 to k is k - 3c/4, and the length of the entire interval is 2c - 3c/4 = 5c/4. So, the probability that the contractor gets the job is:\n\nP(job) = (k - 3c/4) / (5c/4)\n\nThe expected profit is the profit if the contractor gets the job, multiplied by the probability that he gets the job. If the contractor gets the job, his profit is k - c. So, the expected profit is:\n\nE(profit) = (k - c) * (k - 3c/4) / (5c/4)\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of k that maximizes this expression.\n\nTo do this, we can take the derivative of E(profit) with respect to k and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(E(profit))/dk = (1 - c/2) / (5c/4)\n\nSetting this equal to 0, we get:\n\n1 - c/2 = 0\n\nc = 2\n\nHowever, this is not an option. We need to find the value of k in terms of c. We can substitute c = 2 into the expression for E(profit) and find the value of k that maximizes it.\n\nHowever, we can also analyze the problem graphically. The expected profit is a quadratic function of k, and its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/2a.\n\nIn this case, a = -c/4 and b = 1 - c/2. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\nk = -(1 - c/2) / (-c/4) = (4 - 2c) / c\n\nSubstituting c = 2 into this expression, we get:\n\nk = (4 - 4) / 2 = 0\n\nHowever, this is not an option.

We can take the derivative of E(profit) with respect to k and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(E(profit))/dk = (32k - 12c) / (20c)\n\nSetting this equal to 0, we get:\n\n32k - 12c = 0\n\n32k = 12c\n\nk = 3c/2\n\nSo, the contractor should bid 3c/2 to maximize his expected profit.\n\nANSWER: B"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution correctly sets up the probability of the contractor getting the job and the expected profit, and then finds the value of k that maximizes the expected profit by taking the derivative of the expression for E(profit) with respect to k and setting it equal to 0.

Test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the sample proportions of men and women familiar with the shoe polish.\n\nLet's denote the proportion of men familiar with the shoe polish as p1 and the proportion of women familiar with the shoe polish as p2.\n\np1 = (number of men familiar with the shoe polish) / (total number of men)\n= 20 / 100\n= 0.2\n\np2 = (number of women familiar with the shoe polish) / (total number of women)\n= 60 / 200\n= 0.3\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the standard error of the difference between the proportions.\n\nThe standard error of the difference between the proportions is given by the formula:\n\nSE = sqrt((p1 * (1 - p1) / n1 + p2 * (1 - p2) / n2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of men and women, respectively.\n\nSE = sqrt((0.2 * (1 - 0.2) / 100 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.3) / 200)\n= sqrt(0.0016 + 0.00045)\n= sqrt(0.00195)\n= 0.044\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the margin of error for the 95% confidence interval.\n\nThe margin of error for the 95% confidence interval is given by the formula:\n\nME = Z * SE\n\nwhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96.\n\nME = 1.96 * 0.044\n= 0.086\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions.\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions is given by:\n\n(p2 - p1) \u00b1 ME\n\n= (0.3 - 0.2) \u00b1 0.086\n= 0.1 \u00b1 0.086\n\nThe 95% confidence interval is (0.014, 0.186).\n\n### Step 5: Test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal.\n\nSince the 95% confidence interval includes zero, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal.\n\nANSWER: A"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution correctly calculates the sample proportions, standard error, margin of error, and 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions.

Since the admission charge cannot be negative, we only need to consider the endpoint x = 25 (the current admission charge).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the revenue function at the critical points and the endpoint:\n\nRevenue(5) = 400(5)^2 - 4000(5)\n= 400(25) - 20000\n= 10000 - 20000\n= -10000\n\nRevenue(25) = 400(25)^2 - 4000(25)\n= 400(625) - 100000\n= 250000 - 100000\n= 150000\n\nSince the revenue at x = 5 is negative, it is not a feasible solution. Therefore, the maximum revenue occurs at x = 25.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any other local maxima or minima. We can do this by taking the second derivative of the revenue function:\n\nd^2(Revenue)/dx^2 = d(800x - 4000)/dx\n= 800\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the revenue function is concave up, and the critical point x = 5 is a local minimum.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any other local maxima or minima. We can do this by evaluating the revenue function at x = 25 and x = 5:\n\nRevenue(25) = 150000\nRevenue(5) = -10000\n\nSince the revenue at x = 25 is greater than the revenue at x = 5, we can conclude that x = 25 is the global maximum.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any other local maxima or minima.

{"id": 241, "question": "The perfectly competitive videotape-copying industry is composed of many firms that can copy five tapes per day at an average cost of $10 per tape. Each firm must also pay a royalty to film studios, and the per-film royalty rate (r) is an increasing function of total industry output (Q): r = 0.002Q. Demand is given by Q = D(P) = 1,050 - 50P.

Since each firm can copy 5 tapes per day at a cost of $10 per tape, the total cost of producing Q tapes is 10Q. Since there are many firms in the industry, we can assume that the marginal cost (MC) is equal to the average cost (AC). Therefore, MC = AC = 10.\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse demand function, which is the price as a function of quantity demanded. We are given the demand function Q = D(P) = 1,050 - 50P. To find the inverse demand function, we can solve for P:\n\nP = (1,050 - Q) / 50\n\nNow, we need to find the total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC) functions. The total revenue is the price times the quantity sold, so TR = P * Q. Substituting the inverse demand function, we get:\n\nTR = ((1,050 - Q) / 50) * Q\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nTR = 21Q - (Q^2 / 50)\n\nThe total cost (TC) is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost.

Therefore, TC = 10Q.\n\nNow, we need to find the profit-maximizing quantity. To do this, we need to find the marginal revenue (MR) and set it equal to the marginal cost (MC).

The fixed costs are $500.\n4. The material and labor costs total 40 cents per unit.\n\nFirst, let's express the relationship between the price and the number of units sold. We can write an equation based on the given information:\n\nQ = 2000 - 10(P - 2)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nQ = 2000 - 10P + 20\nQ = 2020 - 10P\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue (TR), total cost (TC), and profit (P) functions:\n\nTR = P * Q\nTR = P(2020 - 10P)\n\nTC = Fixed costs + (Material and labor costs * Q)\nTC = 500 + 0.4(2020 - 10P)\n\nNow, let's simplify the TC function:\n\nTC = 500 + 808 - 4P\nTC = 1308 - 4P\n\nThe profit function is:\n\nP = TR - TC\nP = P(2020 - 10P) - (1308 - 4P)\nP = 2020P - 10P^2 - 1308 + 4P\nP = -10P^2 + 2024P - 1308\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical point(s) of the profit function.

We can do this by taking the second derivative of the profit function:\n\nd^2P/dP^2 = -20\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point is a maximum.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the critical point is within the feasible region (i.e., the price is not negative and the number of units sold is not negative). We can plug the critical point back into the equation for Q:\n\nQ = 2020 - 10P\nQ = 2020 - 10(101.2)\nQ = 2020 - 1012\nQ = 1008\n\nSince Q is not negative, the critical point is within the feasible region.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the critical point is an integer, since we can't sell a fraction of a unit. We can round the critical point to the nearest integer:\n\nP \u2248 101.2 \u2192 P = 101\n\nNow, let's check the profit at the critical point and the neighboring points:\n\nP = 100: Q = 2020 - 10(100) = 2020 - 1000 = 1020\nP = 100: TR = 100 * 1020 = 102,000\nP = 100: TC = 1308 - 4(100) = 1308 - 400 = 908\nP = 100: P = 102,000 - 908 = 101,092\n\nP = 101: Q = 2020 - 10(101) = 2020 - 1010 = 1010\nP = 101: TR = 101 * 1010 = 102,010\nP = 101: TC = 1308 - 4(101) = 1308 - 404 = 904\nP = 101: P = 102,010 - 904 = 101,106\n\nP = 102: Q = 2020 - 10(102) = 2020 - 1020 = 1000\nP = 102: TR = 102 * 1000 = 102,000\nP = 102: TC = 1308 - 4(102) = 1308 - 408 = 900\nP = 102: P = 102,000 - 900 = 101,100\n\nAs we can see, the profit is maximized at P = 101.\n\nANSWER: D"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: INCORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution incorrectly identifies the price at which the manufacturer maximizes the profit.

We can write an equation based on the given information:\n\nQ = 2000 - 10(P - 2)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nQ = 2000 - 10P + 20\nQ = 2020 - 10P\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue (TR), total cost (TC), and profit (P) functions:\n\nTR = P * Q\nTR = P(2020 - 10P)\n\nTC = Fixed costs + (Material and labor costs * Q)\nTC = 500 + 0.4(2020 - 10P)\n\nNow, let's simplify the TC function:\n\nTC = 500 + 808 - 4P\nTC = 1308 - 4P\n\nThe profit function is:\n\nP = TR - TC\nP = P(2020 - 10P) - (1308 - 4P)\nP = 2020P - 10P^2 - 1308 + 4P\nP = -10P^2 + 2024P - 1308\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical point(s) of the profit function. We can do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndP/dP = -20P + 2024 = 0\n\nSolving for P:\n\n-20P = -2024\nP = 2024 / 20\nP = 101.2\n\nHowever, we need to check if this critical point is a maximum. We can do this by taking the second derivative of the profit function:\n\nd^2P/dP^2 = -20\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point is a maximum.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the critical point is within the feasible region (i.e., the price is not negative and the number of units sold is not negative). We can plug the critical point back into the equation for Q:\n\nQ = 2020 - 10P\nQ = 2020 - 10(101.2)\nQ = 2020 - 1012\nQ = 1008\n\nSince Q is not negative, the critical point is within the feasible region.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the critical point is an integer, since we can't sell a fraction of a unit. We can round the critical point to the nearest integer:\n\nP \u2248 101.2 \u2192 P = 101\n\nNow, let's check the profit at the critical point and the neighboring points:\n\nP = 100: Q = 2020 - 10(100) = 2020 - 1000 = 1020\nP = 100: TR = 100 * 1020 = 102,000\nP = 100: TC = 1308 - 4(100) = 1308 - 400 = 908\nP = 100: P = 102,000 - 908 = 101,092\n\nP = 101: Q = 2020 - 10(101) = 2020 - 1010 = 1010\nP = 101: TR = 101 * 1010 = 102,010\nP = 101: TC = 1308 - 4(101) = 1308 - 404 = 904\nP = 101: P = 102,010 - 904 = 101,106\n\nP = 102: Q = 2020 - 10(102) = 2020 - 1020 = 1000\nP = 102: TR = 102 * 1000 = 102,000\nP = 102: TC = 1308 - 4(102) = 1308 - 408 = 900\nP = 102: P = 102,000 - 900 = 101,100\n\nAs we can see, the profit is maximized at P = 101.\n\nHowever, we need to check the profit at the neighboring points to see if there is a higher profit at a different price.\n\nP = 100: Q = 2020 - 10(100) = 2020 - 1000 = 1020\nP = 100: TR = 100 * 1020 = 102"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: INCORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution incorrectly calculates the critical point of the profit function and fails to consider the discrete nature of the problem.

First, we need to find the face value of the bonds that will yield an annual income of $3,000 from interest. Since the interest rate is 5%, we can use the formula:\n\n    Interest = Face Value * Interest Rate\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the face value:\n\n    Face Value = Interest / Interest Rate\n\n    Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n    Face Value = $3,000 / 0.05\n    Face Value = $60,000\n\n2.  However, we need to consider the brokerage fee of $5 per bond. Since the bonds sell at 74(7/8), we need to find the selling price of the bonds. \n\n    The selling price is 74(7/8) of the face value, which is:\n\n    Selling Price = 74(7/8) * $60,000\n    Selling Price = 0.7475 * $60,000\n    Selling Price = $44,850\n\n    Since the brokerage fee is $5 per bond, we need to subtract the total brokerage fee from the selling price:\n\n    Total Brokerage Fee = $5 * Number of Bonds\n    We don't know the number of bonds yet, so let's call it x.\n\n    Total Brokerage Fee = $5x\n\n    The total amount invested is the selling price minus the total brokerage fee:\n\n    Total Amount Invested = Selling Price - Total Brokerage Fee\n    Total Amount Invested = $44,850 - $5x\n\n3.  We want to find the number of bonds (x) that will yield an annual income of $3,000 from interest. Since the interest rate is 5%, we can use the formula:\n\n    Interest = Face Value * Interest Rate\n\n    We know the interest is $3,000, and the interest rate is 5%, so we can set up the equation:\n\n    $3,000 = Face Value * 0.05\n\n    We already know the face value is $60,000, so this equation is true. However, we need to find the number of bonds (x) that will yield this interest.\n\n    Since the face value of each bond is $60,000, the total face value of x bonds is:\n\n    Total Face Value = $60,000x\n\n    The interest earned from x bonds is:\n\n    Interest = Total Face Value * Interest Rate\n    Interest = $60,000x * 0.05\n    Interest = $3,000\n\n    We know the interest is $3,000, so we can solve for x:\n\n    $3,000 = $60,000x * 0.05\n    $3,000 = $3,000x\n    x = 1\n\n    So, we need 1 bond with a face value of $60,000 to yield an annual income of $3,000 from interest.\n\n4.  Now that we know the number of bonds (x), we can find the total brokerage fee:\n\n    Total Brokerage Fee = $5x\n    Total Brokerage Fee = $5 * 1\n    Total Brokerage Fee = $5\n\n    The total amount invested is the selling price minus the total brokerage fee:\n\n    Total Amount Invested = Selling Price - Total Brokerage Fee\n    Total Amount Invested = $44,850 - $5\n    Total Amount Invested = $44,845\n\n    However, this is not among the answer choices.

To do this, we need to find the standard labor cost and compare it with the actual labor cost.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the standard labor cost\nStandard labor cost = 40% of the adjusted sales price\nSince the adjusted sales price is not given, we assume it is the total sales. Therefore, the standard labor cost = 40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the labor-cost savings\nLabor-cost savings = Actual labor cost - Standard labor cost\n= $32,000 - $40,000\n= -$8,000 (This is a negative value, which means the actual labor cost is less than the standard labor cost. This is a good sign for the company.)\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative labor-cost savings, we will assume that the actual labor cost is less than the standard labor cost due to some other factors, and the labor-cost savings is the difference between the standard labor cost and the actual labor cost. Therefore, labor-cost savings = $40,000 - $32,000 = $8,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid to the employees as an incentive\nThe employer will retain 30% of the labor-cost savings, and the employees will receive 70%. Therefore, the total amount to be paid to the employees as an incentive = 70% of $8,000\n= 0.7 * $8,000\n= $5,600\n\n### Part (ii): Percentage of wages earned in the quarter that the workers will receive as a bonus\n\nTo find the percentage of wages earned in the quarter that the workers will receive as a bonus, we need to calculate the total wages earned by the employees in the quarter.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total wages earned by the employees in the quarter\nTotal wages earned by the employees in the quarter = Total labor cost\n= $32,000\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of wages earned in the quarter that the workers will receive as a bonus\nPercentage of wages earned in the quarter that the workers will receive as a bonus = (Total amount to be paid to the employees as an incentive / Total wages earned by the employees in the quarter) * 100\n= ($5,600 / $32,000) * 100\n= 17.5%\n\nTherefore, the total amount to be paid to the employees as an incentive is $5,600, and the percentage of wages earned in the quarter that the workers will receive as a bonus is 17.5%.\n\nANSWER: E"], ["VERIFIER", "VERDICT: CORRECT\nCRITIQUE: The solution is well-structured and easy to follow.
