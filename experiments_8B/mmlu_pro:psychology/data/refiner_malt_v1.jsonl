The correct association is that the right frontal lobe is involved in motor functions of the right side of the body.\n\nStep 2:  The back part of the frontal lobe is associated with motor functions, specifically those related to the contralateral side of the body. Since the right frontal lobe's back part is involved in motor functions of the right side of the body, we need to identify which motor function is associated with the right side of the body.\n\nStep 3:  The motor functions of the right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain, specifically the left frontal lobe. However, the right frontal lobe's back part is involved in motor functions of the right side of the body, which means it is associated with the motor function of the right hand.\n\nStep 4:  Therefore, the correct answer is related to the motor function of the right hand.\n\nANSWER: B", "reward": null}

The model is as follows:\n\n1. Contact: The individual is unaware of their racial identity and has not yet encountered any racial issues.\n2. Disintegration: The individual begins to question their racial identity and experiences feelings of guilt and shame.\n3. Reintegration: The individual reasserts their racial identity and rejects the idea of racism.\n4. Pseudo-Independence: The individual believes they are not racist and sees themselves as independent of racism.\n5. Immersion-Emersion: The individual becomes deeply involved in the experiences of the minority group, but may struggle with feelings of guilt and shame.\n6. Internalization: The individual integrates their racial identity and acknowledges the impact of racism.\n7. Integrative Awareness: The individual has a deep understanding of their racial identity and the impact of racism, and is able to work effectively with people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nGiven this information, a White therapist will be most successful when working with a client from an ethnic/racial minority group when they are in the Integrative Awareness stage.

A reflex arc consists of the following components:\n\n1. **Receptor**: This is where the stimulus is detected.
